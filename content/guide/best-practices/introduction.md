In general, Flynt aims to be non-opinionated in regards to the implementation of the front-end stack. In this way, how to author styles and scripts can be left to the individual users.

However, we have bundled together a collection of "Best Practices" that we strongly recommend and support.

**This section is a work in progress.** Our best practices are a living, changing collection of what we believe are the best ways to author your code to match the [core Flynt principles](/guide/getting-started/what-is-flynt/#philosophy) of singularity, reusability, and predictability.
