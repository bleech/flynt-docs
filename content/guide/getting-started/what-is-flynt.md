## Philosophy

Flynt is a component based WordPress framework for development teams and their clients.

Developing websites can be a repetitive process. Flynt is a sustainable approach to website development and content management. Its component-based philosophy resides in 3 core principles:

- **Singularity:** Components are maintainable solutions to specific problems.
- **Reusability:** Components are reusable within and across projects.
- **Predictability:** The scope effects of changing component code or content can easily be foreseen.

## Ecosystem

The Flynt Framework consists of a collection of tools:

- **[Flynt Starter Theme:](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt-starter-theme)** The official WordPress starter theme for building Flynt projects with all of our [best practices](/guide/best-practices/).
- **[Flynt Core Plugin:](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt-core)** The core building block powering the Flynt Framework.
- **[ACF Field Group Composer:](https://github.com/flyntwp/acf-field-group-composer)** A configuration builder for Advanced Custom Fields field groups.
- **[Flynt Docker Build:](https://github.com/flyntwp/docker-flynt-build)** A docker build for quickly setting up and deploying Flynt projects.
- [Flynt Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/flyntwp/generator-flynt): A generator for quickly scaffolding Flynt content.
