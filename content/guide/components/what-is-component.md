A component is a self-contained building-block. As such, each component is kept within its own folder which contains everything it requires; the layout, the Advanced Custom Fields field setup, all necessary WordPress filter and hook logic, scripting, styles, and images.

Building components is a sustainable process, meaning every component you develop can be reused within a project, or in another; increasing your head-start with every new Flynt project.

To quickly and easily build new components, we recommend using the [Flynt Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/flyntwp/generator-flynt).

## What is an area?
Since components are self-contained, areas provide a way to stack our building-blocks together. An area is simply a location within a component where it is possible to add other components.

Areas are most often defined inside [page templates](/guide/configuration/page-templates/#configuring-page-templates) and are output using the helper function `area` in the [view template](/guide/components/view-templates/) of a component.

For example, the `DocumentDefault` component renders the `layout` area in `DocumentDefault/index.twig`:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="flyntComponent {{ body_class }}" lang="{{ site.language }}" dir="{{ dir }}" is="flynt-document-default">
  <head><!--...--></head>
  <body role="document">
    {{ area('layout') }}
    {{ wp_footer }}
  </body>
</html>
```

The `area` helper function is created by the [TimberLoader](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt-starter-theme/blob/master/Features/TimberLoader/README.md) feature using the `renderComponent` filter provided by [Flynt Core](/guide/core/).

## Organizing Components into Categories

Components are always categorized according to their predominant use case. This helps to clarify the purpose of a component and in quickly identifying an appropriate component to re-use. The name of every component is prefixed with one of the following categories:

<div class="alert alert-list">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accordion</strong><br>
      For collapsable content, e.g. FAQs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Block</strong><br>
      The fallback for full width components. Use only when there is no better, more specific category.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Calendar</strong><br>
      For a component where the main feature is a calendar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ComponentLoader</strong><br>
      For a component used only to load other components into it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Document</strong><br>
      A HTML document.
    </li>
